- 👋 Hi, I’m @virtanenanttim2
- 👀 I’m interested in web software development, mainly focusing but not limited to Micorsoft stack. Getting project AgOpenGPS working on my tractor.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure stuff in more depth.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving AgOpenGPS, decoupling the business layer from UI so it could be run without windows PC in tractor.
